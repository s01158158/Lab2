I couldn't seem to find out how to do these, I tried for multiple hours and couldn't seem to find anything online either, so i'm not 
sure if i was searching for the wrong code but this was probably the closest i could seem to get without using code from more 
advanced tutorials i watched to try and figure it out.

acc = 2
>>> for x in range(0, 100):
	acc = acc + x
>>> acc
4952

acc = 1
>>> for x in range(0, 50):
	acc = acc + x
>>> acc
1226
