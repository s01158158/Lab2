I couldn't seem to find out how to do these, I tried for multiple hours and couldn't seem to find anything online either, so i'm not 
sure if i was searching for the wrong code but this was probably the closest i could seem to get without using code from more 
advanced tutorials i watched to try and figure it out.

Nevermind I'm not sure why i couldn't find it anywhere online the past couple of days, but thank you for explaining it really well in 
class, the book doesn't have simple explainations with examples I understand the lesson now.

x = 0
for First100EvenSum in range(0, 201, 2):
	x = x + First100EvenSum
print(x)
10100

n = 0
for First50OddSum in range(1, 50, 2):
	n = n + First50OddSum
print(n)
625

i = 0
for First100Avg in range(1, 100, 2):
	i = i + First100Avg
	
i // 100

print(i)
2500
